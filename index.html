                We make Live, Push and Link — unique software and hardware 
                for music creation and performance. With these products, 
                our community of users creates amazing things.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version 
                of Live in 2001. Our products are used by a community of dedicated 
                musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.

                Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning.
                But when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.
            </h2>
            <p>
                We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving 
                force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the 
                people we make it for.

                We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided
                between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles
                and Tokyo.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of 
                us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural 
                and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
                and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared 
                belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to 
                something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

                We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We only work on a 
                few products and we strive to make them great.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what 
                they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best 
                results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore 
                problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other,
                but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

            </h2>
            <p>
                We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally and 
                professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from 
                and with each other.

            <p>
                Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported 
                in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in 
                their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music salons 
                are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.

                transition as easy as possible.

            <p>
                If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork.
                We’ll even provide you with free German or English lessons. Plus, working
                in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and 
                your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office 
                hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and 
                team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal 
                small-group activities.
